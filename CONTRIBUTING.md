# Contributing to Synthex

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Synthex**!
This project is in its early stages, and we welcome ideas, issues, and pull requests of all kinds.

## What To Contribute On

We welcome contributions of any kind. Typical contributions are done in one of two ways:

1. After using the library, you come across an issue or come up with a possible improvement, so you contribute new code which addresses the shortcoming.
2. You visit the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/tanaos/synthex-python/issues), find a known issue you are interested in working on. Simple issues, perfect for developers who have never / very seldom contributed to open source code, are marked with a badge.

## How To Contribute

Direct pushes to the `master` branch are not permitted. In order to contribute new code, please follow the standard fork --> push --> pull request workflow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add feature"`)
5. Push to your fork (`git push origin feature/my-feature`)
6. Open a pull request

## Guidelines

- Keep your code clean and consistent with existing style.
- Add or update docstrings and comments where helpful.
- If applicable, write or update tests.
- Be constructive in discussions.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue or start a discussion if you're not sure where to begin. We're happy to help!
