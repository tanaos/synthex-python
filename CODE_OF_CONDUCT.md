# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This project is open to contributions from anyone interested. To keep things productive and collaborative, we ask that everyone follows a few basic guidelines when participating.

## How to Participate

You’re welcome to:

- Submit issues, suggestions, and improvements
- Contribute code via pull requests
- Offer constructive feedback or ask questions
- Discuss ideas, implementation details, and priorities

If you disagree with something, that’s fine — just explain your reasoning and move on if consensus isn’t reached.

## Please Avoid

We want to avoid things that create unnecessary friction, such as:

- Personal attacks
- Starting arguments for the sake of it
- Name-calling or intentionally rude behavior
- Taking disagreements too far or making them personal

## Enforcement

Instances of disruptive, hostile or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at info@tanaos.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by members of the project's leadership.

## Final Note

This is an engineering project. We value clarity, logic, and constructive feedback. Treat others the way you'd expect to be treated in a professional collaboration.
